# Project Overview

This project focuses on Machine Learning applications in Water Cherenkov Detectors. All functionalities and analyses are currently contained within the `process.ipynb` file.

## Downloading Data Files

This project includes large data files that are not stored directly in the repository due to their size. To obtain the original files, please follow these instructions:

1. **Install `gdown`:** If you donâ€™t have `gdown` installed, you can install it using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install gdown
    ```

2. **Download Files:** Execute the `download_files.py` script to download the necessary files from Google Drive:

    ```bash
    python download_files.py
    ```

   This script will retrieve all required files and save them in the `AmBe/` directory.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to install several dependencies. You can easily do this by using the `requirements.txt` file included in the repository. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
